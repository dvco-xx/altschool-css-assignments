      <h2 class="about">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am from Imo State but reside in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am a 28-year-old IT enthusiast with an avid love for tech,
        engineering, and design.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I like to think of myself of a jack-of-all-trades but my main focus is
        trying to become a well-rounded web developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the Cloud Engineering track at AltSchool
        Africa.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="goals">My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Altschool Africa to refresh and update my knowledge of
        foundational HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as to upskill in Cloud
        Engineering.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I hope to create a portfolio of projects that showcase my expertise
        across these domains which I believe will also give me an edge in
        today's competitive job market.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have also been a long-time admirer of Altschool's mission to improve
        access to quality, affordable education for Africans across the entire
        continent.
